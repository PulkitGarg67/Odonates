        Odonata, insect order comprising the dragonflies (suborder Anisoptera) and the damselflies (suborder Zygoptera).
        The adults are easily recognized by their two pairs of narrow, transparent wings, sloping thorax, and long, usually
        slender body; the abdomen is almost always longer than any of the wings. Large, active by day, and often strikingly coloured,
        they are usually seen flying near water. Adult odonates are voracious predators, as are the aquatic larvae.\n
        The name dragonfly is commonly applied to all odonates, but it is also used to differentiate the suborder Anisoptera from the suborder Zygoptera. The order Odonata is small and well known; the total number of living species probably does not greatly exceed the 5,000 or so already described. Odonates are globally distributed from the tropics, where they are most numerous and varied, to the boreal forests of Siberia and North America. They are also found throughout the Southern Hemisphere, with the exception of Antarctica.
